# Ask Misty! 
Ask Misty anything about the markets on your Discord server! Features: quick Forex Factory economic calendar references, basic lot size calculations for risk management, and Gemini RAG-powered chats to help you understand Misty's commands.

# In Development:
WIP In progress:
- Custom strategy backtesting engine
- Server persistent strategy definitions  

When we began making this one of the fundamental walls we kept running into was this fact: We didn't know how to do anything! Sure we had a basic idea of stocks and trading but when it comes analyzing strategy and securities to build algorithms around we kept getting stuck. So we decided to pivot: Misty should be a learning bot. When we learn, she learns (the rag gets updated), and by extention, you all learn.

Future Ideas/Goals:
- Larger RAG library of Forex terms/strategy
- In server paper-trading / interaction for users to learn from.
    - trade/interaction analysis & suggestions for improvement
    - leaderboard?
 
## Demo
No setup tutorial right now, but we hope to have Misty deployed very soon on a Raspberry Pi so you don't have to worry about hosting the bot yourself!

## Why
This project originally spawned from a joke between me and my sister about our cat Misty. I don't know why but literally every photo we took of her that day looked like she was getting ready to work or posing for linkedin so we were like "imagine a cat at the desk pushing papers and managing your portfolio or looking at forex stuff all day" and so here we are.



This is misty:
