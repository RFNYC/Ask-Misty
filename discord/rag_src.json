We do not own any of the data scraped. The website is scraped every 10 minutes to check if MONGOKEY parameters such as Actual, Forecasted, and Predicted have been filled in for each event. These parameters are MONGOKEY indicators for how the market responded to an event which is why we try to scrape them in real time as they appear."

From there the data is transported to MongoDB refreshing its data set periodically. After that you can use the FX commands to interact with that data. `/fx-high-impact` filters only the highest impact news, `/fx-currency-lookup <currency>` filter by a single currency, and `/fx-pair-lookup <pair>` allows you to filter news by pair. If you need anymore information you can click the title or head of any of the `/fx` commands and it'll take you to the main site!"
